# C++ Statistics Tool

This project is a simple C++ application with a basic user interface that helps users perform various statistical and probability-related tasks. The operations are selected via a simple menu, and users input the required data to get calculated results.

üìå Features

The program supports the following operations:

1. **Random Number Generation**
   - User specifies range and count.
   - Supports both repeated and non-repeated number generation.

2. **Systematic Random Sampling**
   - User inputs population size (N) and sample size (n).
   - Calculates interval `k = N/n`, generates the starting point randomly, and creates the sample.

3. **Simple Series**
   - User inputs a set of values.
   - Values are sorted in ascending order.

4. **Frequency Series**
   - Calculates how many times each value appears (fi).

5. **Frequency Table**
   - Calculates class limits, boundaries, frequencies, cumulative frequencies, midpoints, relative frequencies, and cumulative relative frequencies.

6. **Central Tendency Measures**
   - Computes mean, median, and mode.

7. **Measures of Dispersion**
   - Computes variance, standard deviation, mean absolute deviation, Q1, Q3, and coefficient of variation.

8. **Permutation and Combination**
   - Calculates `nPr` and `nCr` for given `n` and `r`.
